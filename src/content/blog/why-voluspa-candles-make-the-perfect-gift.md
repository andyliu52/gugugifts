## A Candle That Feels Like a Gift Before You Even Light It

There's a reason Voluspa has become one of the most recognized names in luxury home fragrance. Walk into any beautifully curated gift shop, and you'll almost certainly spot those iconic embossed tins and textured glass jars. They're the kind of candle you don't want to hide in a cabinet — you want it front and center on your coffee table.

At **Gugu Gifts**, we're proud to carry Voluspa as one of our featured brands when we open our doors in Terrell, Texas. Here's why we think they make the perfect gift for just about anyone on your list.

## Hand-Poured with a Coconut Wax Blend

Unlike many mass-produced candles, Voluspa uses a proprietary coconut wax blend that burns cleanly and evenly. There are no parabens, no phthalates, and no sulfates. For anyone who's conscious about what they bring into their home, that matters. The clean burn also means the fragrance fills the room without being overwhelming — it's sophisticated, not suffocating.

## The Jar Is the Gift

One of the things that sets Voluspa apart is their packaging. The decorative tins and hand-painted glass vessels are genuinely beautiful objects. Many people repurpose them as jewelry holders, makeup brush cups, or small planters long after the candle is gone. When you give a Voluspa candle, you're giving something that lasts beyond the last flicker.

## A Fragrance for Every Personality

From the warm, woodsy notes of **Baltic Amber** to the bright citrus of **Goji Tarocco Orange** to the romantic **Champagne Rose**, Voluspa's range is wide enough that you can match a scent to anyone's taste. Not sure what they'd like? The Japonica collection is universally loved and always a safe bet.

## Why We Chose Voluspa for Gugu Gifts

When we were curating the brands for our new shop, Voluspa was one of the first on our list. It fits perfectly with our mid-luxe philosophy: beautiful things that feel special but aren't out of reach. A Voluspa candle says *"I thought about you"* without the intimidation factor of a high-end price tag.

Whether it's a housewarming, a birthday, a thank-you, or just a Tuesday treat-yourself moment, Voluspa delivers.

## Visit Us Soon

We're getting ready to open at **301 Tanger Dr, Suite 112, Terrell, TX 75126**. Follow us for updates on our grand opening, and be among the first to shop our curated collection of Voluspa candles and so much more.
